            Having spent time with you I have discovered a lot about myself, both good and bad and I feel like
            you have become a very important part of my life. I love being able to spend moments with you and hope
            I can continue spending time with you. I love how thoughtful and caring you can be especially when I am
            towards me, even when I don't deserve it. I love how supportive you are, you never fail to help push me to
            keep pursuing my goals. I want to be able to support you in the years to come and any endeavors or paths you decide to take.</h3>
